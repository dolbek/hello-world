Hello World repo, for learning GitHub as part of COMP3521

## About Me

My name is Jesse Dean, and I live in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I am currently in my third year of pursuing a Bachelor's of Computing Science degree.
I hope to start my CS career as a software engineer in Vancouver, and see where things take me. I am potentially interested in working in application security,
embedded systems, machine learning, or software development in something like C or C++.

### About This GitHub Account

For now, I intend to use this GitHub account to store any personal projects or school projects of note, with the intent of contributing to some interesting open
source projects as time allows.
